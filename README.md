# Multivariate Logistic CPMs
Repo for the paper entitled "Clinical Prediction Models to Predict the Risk of Multiple Binary Outcomes: a comparison of multivariate approaches", which is published in Statistics in Medicine (2020). This paper is published open-access here: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.8787

The paper explores statistical methodology to allow the development of clinical prediction models (CPMs) for two binary outcomes simultaneously, rather than modelling as seperate outcomes. An overview is given here: https://glenmartin31.github.io/blog/2020/10/28/when

The repo contains the coding scripts and results from the simulation study described in the paper as follows:
## Code sub-folder
This contains the R scripts used in the simulation study. Additionally, this folder also contains the SQL script used to extract the cohort from the MIMIC-III database, which was used as part of the empirical study described in the paper.

## Data sub-folder
This contains a .rmd file of the results of the simulation, as described in the paper. The Data sub-folder also contains the predictive performance results of the MIMIC-III real-world example, as described in the paper.
